# Device wattages — verification procedure

This document is the **source of truth for how the device catalog gets its typical
values and their verification stamps**: `typicalVa` in
`src/catalog/appliance-presets.ts` and `typicalMcaA`/`typicalMocpA` in
`src/catalog/ac-presets.ts`. It mirrors PRICES.md: a written procedure, a
never-invent rule, per-entry provenance, and a shrinking known-gap list
(`KNOWN_UNVERIFIED_APPLIANCES` / `KNOWN_UNVERIFIED_AC` in
`packages/engine/test/wattage-verification.test.ts`).

## Policy

- **Never invent a wattage.** A `verifiedAt` stamp (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, the date of
  the research run) requires one of:
  - a **citable published spec sheet or manual** for a model actually sold in
    El Salvador (`source` = the URL), or
  - a **user-confirmed nameplate** (`source: 'placa — verificado por el usuario'`).
- "Typical" means representative of mainstream units in the Salvadoran market.
  Brands to check: **Cetron, Mabe, Whirlpool, Frigidaire, Oster, LG, Samsung**;
  A/C: **Comfee, Midea, TCL, Pioneer, Mirage**.
- Stamps are **replaced in place** on re-verification; git history is the audit trail.
- **Respect access declarations** (same rule as PRICES.md): if a manufacturer or
  retailer site refuses AI-agent access via robots.txt or content signals, do not
  work around it; record the miss in the run report and leave that entry to manual
  research.

### W vs VA

- **Resistive appliances** (ducha, termo, estufa, horno, plancha): nameplate W is
  taken as VA 1:1.
- **Motor / electronic loads** (bomba, refri, congelador, lavadora, micro, tv):
  prefer nameplate `A × V`; if only W is published, record the conversion in the
  ledger row.
- **Motors sized by the code itself**: where the NEC prescribes Table 430.248 FLC
  over nameplate (430.6(A)(1); motor loads enter the calc via 120.11), the table
  value is itself a citable source — stamp with the table reference. Research
  showing real nameplates BELOW the table value supports the stamp (the table is
  deliberately conservative); nameplates above it would be a finding to log.
- **A/C entries**: never use spec-sheet "cooling watts" (that is thermal output,
  not electrical draw). The appliance `ac-*` VA values are **derived**:
  `typicalVa ≈ (typicalMcaA ÷ 1.25) × 230 V`, rounded to 10 VA (440.4(B) rationale,
  see the appliance-presets.ts docblock; enforced by
  `packages/engine/test/properties.test.ts`). They are **derived-verified**: verify
  the MCA/MOCP preset against spec sheets, then stamp **both twins with the same
  date** (`wattage-verification.test.ts` enforces the lockstep; the appliance twin
  keeps `source: 'derivado de ac-presets.ts …'`).

### Changing a value is a separate, deliberate step

Verification runs that **confirm** current values only add stamps — they never touch
engine goldens. A run that finds a value materially off logs it under **Proposed
value changes** below and stops there. Applying a proposed change is its own commit
that updates `packages/engine/test/golden/load-calc.json` in step (goldens hard-code
preset-driven totals, e.g. ac-12k 1840 + bomba 1200 → 7795) and re-derives any
hand-computed case that names the old value.

## Ledger

Cross-check target (out of scope to merge): `src/catalog/presets.ts` carries
overlapping hand-derived values (`ducha-3500`/`ducha-4400` in W,
`estufa`/`secadora` in demand A). When a ledger row gets verified, eyeball those
for contradiction and note it here if found.

## Proposed value changes

Logged by the 2026-08-30 run — **not applied**; each needs a deliberate commit that
updates `golden/load-calc.json` in step, and ideally the user's nameplate check first.

| id | current | proposal | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ducha | 4,400 VA | consider **5,400** | CA staples cluster 5,400–5,500 W (Corona Gorducha 5,500/5,400; Thermoducha 5,500; Lorenzetti Maxi 5,500); economy models 3,960–4,320 W exist, so 4,400 undersizes the common case |
| estufa | 9,600 VA | needs a LATAM total-connected figure | US smooth-tops publish 12–13 kW; Mabe coil-top totals unpublished (surface alone 6,600 W — oven elements could plausibly land near 9.6 kW, unconfirmed) |
| secadora | 5,000 VA | consider **5,400** | GE 5,600 W/24 A, Whirlpool element 5,400 W; at exactly 5,000 the 120.54 floor hides the difference |
| micro | 1,200 VA | consider **1,500** | 1,000 W-output units draw ~1,600 W input (LG/Samsung); only the 800 W-output class lands near 1,150 |
| congelador | 500 VA | consider **300** | Mabe nameplates 100–175 VA; Frigidaire retail «5 A» (600 VA) is the only high figure and is secondary |
| lavadora | 1,200 VA | consider **1,000** | Mabe 6–8 A @ 110–127 V ≈ 720–1,016 VA; Whirlpool input 248–709 W |
| ac-9k MCA | 7 A | propose **10 A** (MOCP 15 confirmed) | every published 9k MCA is 9–13 A; 7 A would undersize the derived VA too (1,290 → ~1,840) |
| ac-24k MOCP | 25 A | propose **30 A** (MCA 17 confirmed) | 30 A dominant across TCL/MrCool/Midea/Pioneer; only Senville pairs 24.9/25 |
| ac-36k | MCA 24 / MOCP 40 | propose **MCA 25 / MOCP 35** | observed MCA floor is 25 (3 of 4 models); MOCP median 35 (30/35/35/40) |

## Run reports

### 2026-09-30 — user nameplate (no research pass)

- **Stamped (1 AC + 1 appliance twin):** `ac-12k-115v`, from the user's own Samsung
  AR40H12D0BMX plate (115 V, 11.8 A nominal, 17.5 A máx, 1,090 W). First entry whose
  provenance is a nameplate rather than a spec sheet, and the first whose plate marks
  corriente nominal/máxima instead of MCA/MOCP — the derivation lives in the engine
  (`acNameplate`, 440.6 / 440.32 / 440.22(A)), not in the catalog, so the stored
  values are the plate's own.
- **Wattage:** 1,090 W is the plate's rated power input, so `typicalWVerifiedAt` is
  stamped too (removed from KNOWN_UNVERIFIED_W by construction — the entry was never in it).

### 2026-08-30 run report

Three research passes (resistive/kitchen, motor/electronic, mini-split MCA/MOCP)
against published manufacturer spec sheets, manuals, and submittals (Lorenzetti,
Corona, Boccherini, Thermoducha, Rheem/Camco, Frigidaire, GE, Whirlpool, Mabe,
Oster, Black+Decker, Samsung, LG, Truper/Pretul, Pedrollo, Midea, TCL, Pioneer,
MrCool, Senville).

- **Stamped (8 appliance + 2 AC entries):** termo, horno, plancha, lavaplatos, tv,
  bomba (NEC-table basis), and the ac-12k/ac-18k twin pairs. Sets shrunk 17→9 and
  5→3.
- **Findings without a clean match:** logged above as proposed changes; no value
  was edited, goldens untouched.
- **Misses:** LG/Samsung refrigerator pages publish kWh, not rated amps; Comfee
  publishes no MCA/MOCP anywhere public; Mirage fichas list only running amperaje;
  AJ Madison served 403; Samsung/LG dryer sheets state «240 V / 30 A» without watts.
- **Compliance:** freundferreteria.com and sv.epaenlinea.com not fetched (AI
  opt-out); vidri.com.sv not fetched (challenge — no workaround attempted).

## Agent prompt (copy-paste verbatim to run a verification pass)

```text
Run a wattage verification pass on this repo. Read packages/data/WATTAGES.md and
follow it exactly. For each `por verificar` ledger row, research published spec
sheets (WebSearch/WebFetch) for models sold in El Salvador from the listed brands.
Stamp `verifiedAt` (today) + `source` in appliance-presets.ts / ac-presets.ts ONLY
where the published spec matches the current value within rounding; A/C entries:
verify the MCA preset and stamp both twins with the same date. Log mismatches under
"Proposed value changes" — do NOT edit any typicalVa/typicalMcaA value. Remove newly
stamped ids from KNOWN_UNVERIFIED_* in
packages/engine/test/wattage-verification.test.ts, update the ledger statuses, add a
dated run report, then run `pnpm -r test` and `pnpm -r typecheck` from the repo
root. Engine goldens must pass unchanged — a golden diff means a value was
accidentally edited.
```
